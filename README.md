Target: Voice Assistant to open apps using machine learning

Step 1: Capture voice clip.
Step 2: Link voice clip to application path, by speech to text or direct machine learning.
Step 3: Design GUI app which remains active in background and starts capturing voice when it hears a certain keyword.
Step 4: Open the requested app.

Main problem to avoid: Do not ask user again and again for some action.
